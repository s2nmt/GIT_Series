# How to use git clean

## Introduction
Git clean is a command used to clear files or folders that are not added. For example, if you have a file named hello.txt and you haven't used the git add command, you can clear it with: 
- git clean -n. This will show the names of files that can be delete.
- git clean -f. This will delete files that have not been added.
